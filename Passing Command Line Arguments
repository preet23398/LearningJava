//Sometimes, the situation may demand us to use command line arguments as our input.
//Command line arguments are the ones we pass through our command prompt (in Windows), through terminal or through console.

//Here is an example that aims at sorting out the confusion for beginners.

//Before we pass the arguments, we must ensure that our program has no compilation error and is running.

//Steps:
//Open cmd and type the following:
//javac Testingg.java 
//Hit enter
//java Testingg arg1 arg2
//Hit enter

//Note that where I have written Testingg, you must write the file name you created.
//This is how we pass command line arguments to our program.

public class Testingg {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        //Input is taken as an array of string elements which are space separated

        //Assigning these values
        String a,b;
        a = args[0];
        b = args[1];

        //Converting these string elements into int
        int c,d;
        c = Integer.parseInt(a);
        d = Integer.parseInt(b);

        //Calculating their sum
        int sum = sum(c,d);

        //Printing out the sum
        System.out.println("The sum is: " + (sum));
    }

    //Function to caluclate the sum
    private static int sum(int i, int j) {
        int result = i+j;
        return result;
    }
}
